## 🔄 Usage Guide

### 1. Create Session and Login to WhatsApp

```bash
# 1. Create new session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "mysession"}'

# 2. Open QR code in browser
# http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/mysession/qr-page

# 3. Scan QR code with WhatsApp on your phone

# 4. Check connection status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/mysession/status
```

### 🔧 QR Code Login Success Tips

Based on latest fixes (v1.2.0), QR code login process is now more stable:

✅ **What's Fixed:**
- No need to scan QR code repeatedly
- System automatically handles restart after pairing
- Session data preserved during login process

✅ **Login Success Tips:**
```bash
# 1. Create session and wait for QR code to appear
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/create \
  -d '{"sessionId": "stable-session"}'

# 2. Open QR page in browser  
# http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/stable-session/qr-page

# 3. Monitor logs in terminal to see progress:
# - "QR Code generated" ✅
# - "pairing configured successfully" ✅  
# - "Restart required after pairing" ✅
# - "successfully connected as..." ✅

# 4. Check final status
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/stable-session/status
```

⚠️ **If Still Failing:**
```bash
# 1. Restart session
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/stable-session/restart

# 2. Or delete and recreate  
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/stable-session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/create \
  -d '{"sessionId": "stable-session"}'
```

### 2. Send OTP

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/messages/mysession/otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "08123456789",
    "companyName": "PT. Example"
  }'
```

### 3. Send Image with Upload

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/messages/mysession/image \
  -F "to=08123456789" \
  -F "caption=This is example image" \
  -F "image=@/path/to/image.jpg"
```

### The VibeCoding Philosophy 🚀

```javascript
while (project.isNotComplete()) {
  claude.think();
  claude.code();
